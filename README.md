# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 24 2021

## Theme
The idea of a survival based game requires you to think about death in terms of completing the level, and the game ends when you die. You only have 3 deaths before you lose the game, so in our eyes, every death counts, so the goal is to optimize the time and score with the lives you have.

## Game Play
The goal of this top-down 2D shooter is to survive the waves of oncoming Jasons for as long as possible while racking up a high score. The player progresses through three different levels but only moves on to another level when they die. Each level is complete with their own weapon, map, and enemies and the player's total score is calculated at the end of all three levels.

## Impediments
Liam: Levels took longer to make than I thought, until I discovered the copy paste function a couple hours before the deadline, when I only had one more level to make.

Wyeth: My first major difficulty was making the character shoot while following the mouse. I was able to have a player shoot in a straight line but struggled to get the player to shoot when my mouse pointed. Another difficulty was figuring out how to rotate the bullets so that they pointed towards my mouse every time they shot. Also, adding a timer to the gun's fire rate took some time to tweak and fully instantiate as it shot the bullets.
## Implementation
Liam: 3 Levels With Different Themes
Wyeth: Moveable character with different weapon skins and bullets, muzzle flash and impact explosisions, beginning and end scenes, score and player health.
