# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 24 2021

## Theme
The idea of a survival based game requires you to think about death in terms of completing the level, and the game ends when you die. You only have 3 deaths before you lose the game, so in our eyes, every death counts, so the goal is to optimize the time and score with the lives you have.

## Game Play
Objective
Game-play instructions

## Impediments
Liam: Levels took longer to make than I thought, until I discovered the copy paste function a couple hours before the deadline, when I only had one more level to make.

## Implementation
-3 Levels With Different Themes
